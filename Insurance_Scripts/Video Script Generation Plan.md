# Video Script Generation Process for Novo Insurance

Based on my research, here's the comprehensive plan for generating viral short video scripts:

## 1. Script Format Structure
Each script will follow the templates from "Scripting Video Templates.md" with these key elements:
- **Format Type** (Comedy, Educational Hook, Transformation, etc.)
- **Duration** (30 seconds - optimized for social media engagement)
- **Hook** (First 3 seconds - critical for stopping scroll)
- **Structure** (Hook → Setup → Escalation → Payoff → CTA)
- **Full Script** with time markers
- **Visual directions** for each segment

## 2. Content Sources
From the Story Bank folder, we have:
- **Claude AI - story bank.md**: 100+ Reddit driving safety posts with links
- **Perplexity - Viral Topics Appendix.md**: 145+ categorized stories with YouTube/Reddit links
- **Open AI PDF**: 60+ inspiring/cautionary stories with detailed narratives

## 3. Script Generation Workflow

### Step 1: Story Selection & Categorization
- Create a story database from all sources
- Tag stories by theme (road rage, defensive driving, safety tech, etc.)
- Prioritize high-engagement stories (100+ upvotes/40+ comments)

### Step 2: Script Development Process
For each selected story:
1. **Extract core narrative** - What happened? Key lesson?
2. **Choose appropriate format** - Match story type to template
3. **Write compelling hook** - Must grab attention in 3 seconds
4. **Develop full script** - Follow template structure with actual content
5. **Add Novo messaging** - Integrate brand values naturally
6. **Include visual cues** - Specific shots and transitions

## 4. Implementation Tools

### A. Script Generator Tool
Create a Python script that:
- Reads story data from CSV/JSON files
- Matches stories to appropriate templates
- Generates draft scripts with proper formatting
- Ensures Novo brand compliance

### B. Quality Assurance Checklist
Each script must have:
- ✓ Actual content (no placeholders)
- ✓ Novo mission alignment
- ✓ Proper format structure
- ✓ Compelling hook
- ✓ Clear visual directions
- ✓ Appropriate CTA

## 5. Sample Implementation

I'll create:
1. A structured database of all stories
2. A script generation tool with file saving capability
3. Sample scripts demonstrating different formats (saved to `output/sample_scripts.md`)
4. Guidelines for ongoing script creation

### Script Storage Protocol
- **All generated scripts** should be saved to `output/sample_scripts.md` for centralized access
- **Output folder** contains all generated script files for clean organization
- **30-second duration** standardized across all scripts for optimal social media performance
- Include table of contents with format types and engagement metrics
- Each script includes source verification and Novo brand integration notes

### Format Update (Latest)
All scripts have been updated to 30-second format to maximize engagement on TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts. This timing provides optimal balance between content depth and attention span retention.

This process ensures consistent, high-quality video scripts that align with Novo's vision while leveraging proven viral content strategies.
