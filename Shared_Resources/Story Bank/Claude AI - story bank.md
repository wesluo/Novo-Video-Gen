## Key Safety Themes Across All Posts

The research reveals several dominant safety themes:

1. **Dashcam Evidence Value**: Multiple posts demonstrate how dashcams protect innocent drivers and expose fraud
2. **Distracted Driving**: Phone use, eating, and other distractions causing accidents
3. **Emergency Vehicle Rights**: Blocking ambulances and fire trucks
4. **Weather-Related Safety**: Visibility, road conditions, and appropriate driving adjustments
5. **Insurance Fraud Prevention**: Staged accidents and false claims
6. **Aggressive Driving**: Road rage, brake checking, tailgating

9. **Age-Related Issues**: Elderly drivers and reaction times
10. **Technology Limitations**: Autopilot failures and over-reliance on systems

## Research Limitations

Due to Reddit's 2023 API restrictions, we encountered challenges:
- Many posts lack complete direct Reddit URLs
- Some engagement metrics are estimates from news coverage
- Access to current 2024-2025 posts was limited
- Comment counts not available for all posts

Despite these limitations, the compiled posts represent high-engagement content (most with 1,000+ upvotes) that effectively illustrates driving safety lessons. The posts span various subreddits and safety topics, providing Novo with diverse content examples for creating driving safety awareness materials.

## Recommendations for Novo

1. **Focus on Dashcam Content**: The highest engagement comes from clear video evidence
2. **Emphasize Consequences**: Posts showing real outcomes get more engagement
3. **Include Self-Reflection**: Posts where OPs admit fault generate discussion
4. **Target Multiple Angles**: Cover fraud, weather, technology, and human error
5. **Use Compelling Titles**: Direct, descriptive titles perform best
6. **Cross-Post Strategy**: Popular posts often appear across multiple subreddits

This compilation provides a foundation for understanding what driving safety content resonates with Reddit's community, even though the full 100+ posts with complete data wasn't achievable due to platform restrictions.
