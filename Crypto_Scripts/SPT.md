## Quick Summary

**SPT** is a next-gen web3 rewards ecosystem that incentivizes **safe driving** through a digital token, distributed daily to drivers who use the SP Drive app and demonstrate responsible driving behavior. Tokens can be redeemed for gift cards, safety equipment, or sweepstakes (like Bitcoin prizes), with marketplace revenues recycled to buy back SPT, boosting its value and forging a community-led movement for safer roads and fairer insurance[^1].

## Campaign Concept ("Movement" Angle)

**Tagline Ideas:**

- “Drive Smart. Get Rewarded.”
- “Every Safe Mile Counts.”
- “Earn for Safety. Win for Life.”
- “Safer You. Better Roads. Real Rewards.”

**Big Idea:**
Position SPT as more than a crypto—it’s a positive movement where “safety pays” and every trip helps build a safer community. The process is as easy as “Drive → Earn → Redeem,” contributing to a fairer, tech-driven insurance system and tangible personal rewards.

**Core Flywheel (Visual/Concept):**

1. Drive safely (measured automatically)
2. Earn SPT tokens
3. Redeem tokens for real-world rewards or sweepstakes
4. Marketplace revenue buys back tokens
5. Ecosystem value and community grow
6. More safe driving = more impact (flywheel)

## Branding Guidelines

**Brand Personality:**

- Trustworthy, transparent, community-driven, cutting-edge, uplifting.

**Visual Style:**

- **Colors:** Use blues (trust, tech) and energetic greens (growth, safety), accents of gold or silver (rewards, value).
- **Icons:** Circles/flywheels for continuous value, shield or checkmark for safety, coins/tokens for rewards, simple app/phone graphics.
- **Imagery:** Diverse, smiling drivers; digital dashboard/phone screens; roadways; subtle blockchain motifs.
- **Typography:** Modern, sans-serif. Keep language clear and actionable.

**Messaging Do’s:**

- Emphasize *real-world utility*: “Earn gift cards, not just points.”
- Highlight *movement/join-in* ethos: “Join the Safety Promotor Club.”
- Spotlight *impact*: “Help cut road accidents by 30%.”

**Compliance Notes:**

- Never promise speculative profit or investment gains.
- Center messaging on utility and community impact, not crypto trading.
- Keep reward narratives factual: “Win prizes,” not “guaranteed gains.”
- DO: “Reward for attentiveness, not financial speculation.”
- Avoid: “Token price will rise,” or similar financial claims.
- Make clear: Rewards not tied to buying insurance or other regulated triggers[^1].
